# Watcher continuity

The watcher remains intentionally one-shot: one actionable reason closes one watcher cycle.
Must-work continuity now lives above that process boundary instead of depending on the model remembering a re-arm step.

## Ownership

Pi's `.pi/extensions/fm-primary-pi-watch.ts`, OMP's `.omp/extensions/fm-primary-omp.ts`, and OpenCode's `.opencode/plugins/fm-primary-watch-arm.js` own continuous re-arm after an actionable child close.
Pi and OMP are thin adapters over the shared lifecycle core in `bin/fm-primary-watch-core.ts`; each keeps its own runtime identity, event bindings, and follow-up delivery.
Because both files decide watcher behavior, a loaded adapter's marker version hashes the adapter and that shared core together - `bin/fm-primary-watch-version-lib.sh` is the one definition verifiers recompute from.
Editing only the core therefore makes a running session's marker stale, and `bin/fm-session-start.sh` prints the exact restart fallback instead of accepting a live session that still runs the old core.
Each adapter starts the next arm before delivering the wake prompt, checks current session-lock ownership at launch, preserves one child or scheduled retry at a time, and applies bounded exponential retry after an unexpected or failed close.
A failed follow-up never cancels continuity restoration.
Same-process session replacement on Pi and OMP follows the generation-owner contract stated once in `bin/fm-primary-watch-core.ts`.
Claude's `.claude/settings.json` Stop `asyncRewake` hook (`bin/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.sh`) owns routine tokenless re-arm.
The hook fires on every Stop, and an eligible primary with supervision need admits one home-scoped owner that foregrounds `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` inside the hook-owned process tree.
A numeric session-lock owner that fails the shared `fm_harness_pid_alive` predicate is reclaimed through `bin/fm-lock.sh` before auto-arm state changes, while a live owner, absent lock, or malformed lock keeps the competing hook inert.
The stale-owner claim occurs only after the existing AFK and supervision-need gates pass.
After each non-actionable arm close, the hook rechecks the identity-matched watcher lock and fresh beacon before retrying a bounded number of times.
A cycle-end failure is benign when that live-watcher predicate is true, and the hook suppresses the arm output and continues silently.
Only an exhausted failure with no verified watcher emits one last-resort notice for the continuous failure episode; later consecutive Stop cycles exit 2 to guarantee another Stop-owned retry without repeating the notice until the turn-end guard consumes the attended fail-open.
The Claude turn-end guard owns the monotonic failure progression, one-time attended fail-open, post-alarm continuation suppression, and positive recovery reset described in [`turnend-guard.md`](turnend-guard.md#harness-integrations).
While supervision is still needed and away mode remains inactive, an actionable close wakes the idle session through exit 2.

## Actionable wake ordering

After an actionable Pi, OMP, or OpenCode child close, the adapter starts and verifies one singleton successor before it delivers the original wake.
OMP delivers that follow-up through its host API as a hidden custom `steer` with `triggerTurn`, which starts an idle handling turn without touching an editable TUI draft.
It confirms the handling handoff against that successor before scheduling the follow-up, retries once against the current generation and successor, and treats a failed confirmation as a restoration failure: it classifies the error, retires a successor that is no longer alive, and surfaces exactly one typed message.
A failed confirmation is never swallowed.
It waits at most one readiness timeout per attempt, then sends TERM and waits a bounded retirement confirmation before the next lock-verified exponential retry.
If the unready arm does not retire within that bound, the adapter keeps ownership, starts no overlapping retry, and delivers the typed fallback immediately.
When that retained arm later closes, its actual close is classified as a new supervised event without replaying the earlier fallback.
After the configured retry bound is exhausted, it delivers the original wake with a typed continuity-restoration failure even if every successor arm hung without reporting readiness.
This is deliberate Option B ordering: the fleet is protected before the model handles the wake whenever restoration succeeds, but the model is never left blind when it does not.

Claude's Stop hook starts the successor arm at the next Stop after the handling turn, rather than before notification as Pi, OMP, and OpenCode do.
The durable wake queue preserves actionable events during the residual active-turn window, and the bounded turn-end guard enforces recovery at Stop when no watcher or auto-arm claim is present.
For every supported arm path, a successor that observes an accepted down stretch emits `check: rearm-resurface` through the ordinary durable handling path before settling into its live wait.
That recovery presentation includes all unacknowledged queue rows and the bounded view of the existing cursor-folded OPEN DECISIONS set, so a still-open decision reappears even when recovery has no queue row of its own.
The drain fails closed without publishing a usable acknowledgement when the OPEN DECISIONS scan or output cannot complete, so a partial presentation cannot retire the recovery episode.
The recovery-episode contract below owns once-per-generation announcement.
A handling successor does not re-announce; it enters its poll loop immediately and keeps scanning signals, stale panes, and checks.
The model no longer re-arms after ordinary wakes.
No PreToolUse hook denies fleet commands based on watcher status.
A genuine auto-arm failure describes the automatic mechanism as broken and never directs a routine manual background arm.
Terminal arm-output classification (`started`, `attached`, or `FAILED`) remains defense in depth for the manual recovery path.
Codex retains its bounded foreground checkpoint protocol.
Grok retains its tracked background-task notification protocol.
No adapter starts a replacement with shell `&`.

The turn-end guard remains the final backstop rather than the normal continuity mechanism and cooperates with the auto-arm in its `--claude` mode.

## Recovery episode acknowledgement

A recovery episode is one generation of `state/.watcher-down`, and it is retired only by the generation-bound acknowledgement the drain prints as `WAKE_ACK_REQUIRED`.
An unacknowledged downtime generation is announced at most once: the first recovery marks that generation announced, and later arms wait until a new down stretch mints a new generation.
A non-successor watcher start after an announced-but-unacked episode is a new down stretch and mints a fresh generation so buried decisions still resurface once.
Every watcher close and every durable queue append publishes downtime, so a downtime republication of any pending episode reuses its generation instead of minting a new one, and an already-announced generation stays announced.
That reuse keeps a watcher close inside the handling window from orphaning the acknowledgement already presented and trapping later arms in repeated recovery presentation.
An acknowledgement carries two separable facts: queue-row consumption is bound to the monotonic `--ack-through` sequence, while only retiring the episode is bound to `--recovery-generation`.
A generation mismatch therefore does not block consumption of rows through that sequence; it is a non-fatal result that names its own remedy - re-drain, then acknowledge the newer episode.
The acknowledgement retires the marker only when no rows remain after sequence-bound consumption.
A concurrently appended wake has a higher sequence, remains queued, and keeps the episode pending for presentation.
Consequently, an empty-queue downtime publication during handling can be retired by the outstanding acknowledgement without a dedicated recovery turn.
An acknowledged episode does not freeze the generation, because the next downtime after it opens an episode of its own.

## Recovery-marker lock reentrancy

`bin/fm-watch.sh`'s EXIT trap performs a recovery-marker transition, so a signal can fire that trap while an interrupted frame is still inside a marker critical section.
Waiting there for a lock the same process already holds can never be satisfied: the watcher spins forever, ignores every later signal, and pins `state/.wake-queue.lock` with it, which wedges the whole home rather than one cycle.
`bin/fm-wake-lib.sh`'s `fm_lock_held_by_self` therefore lets a marker transition detect that it reentered a lock this process already owns, proceed under the exclusion it already has, and leave the lock exactly as the interrupted frame left it.
The exiting process abandons that lock, and `fm_lock_try_acquire` reclaims a dead owner's lock the same way it always has.
Reentry is scoped to self-ownership only: a live foreign holder still blocks, and the bounded caller still reports exhaustion, so exclusion between processes is unchanged.
`tests/fm-wake-queue.test.sh` drives the exact shape - hold the marker lock, run the transitions the EXIT trap uses, then prove a live foreign holder is still not treated as reentry.

## Arm-layer cycle contract

`bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` never returns a clean empty success.
An actionable child output returns that reason normally.
A zero/empty child return rechecks the home lock and beacon, attaches to a verified healthy successor when one exists, or resolves the close against the watcher's bounded terminal-delivery ledger.
An attached arm follows verified identity-matched successors and resolves the same way when that chain ends without one, because it holds no handle on the watcher's stdout and cannot read the reason line itself.
Before releasing its singleton lock after printing an actionable reason, the watcher records that reason with its PID and process identity in `state/.watch-deliveries.log`.
A matching PID and identity lets an attached arm report the delivered reason and exit zero even after its durable wake was handled and acknowledged, while an unrelated queue producer or a recycled PID cannot satisfy the match.
Only a cycle with no matching delivery record emits `watcher: FAILED - cycle ended without an actionable reason` and exits nonzero.

The arm layer appends one tab-separated record per observed cycle to `state/.watch-cycle-exits.log`.
Each record includes arm and watcher PIDs, start and end timestamps, exit code and signal, classified reason, beacon age, lock identity before and after close, and successor disposition.
The file is size-capped through `FM_WATCH_CYCLE_LOG_MAX_BYTES` and `FM_WATCH_CYCLE_LOG_KEEP_LINES`.
`state/.watch-triage.log` remains only the watcher's bounded absorbed-wake debug log and carries no lifecycle semantics.

The default 300-second grace is unchanged.
Only the watcher process touches `state/.last-watcher-beat`; no helper process can make a wedged watcher appear healthy.

## Regression coverage

`tests/fm-pi-watch-extension.test.sh` checks Pi's first-cycle-or-explicit-repair tool metadata and ownership-based redundant-call no-ops, then simulates actionable and empty child closes against the actual Pi and OpenCode close handlers, blocks prompt delivery to prove the successor launches first, verifies single-flight behavior, changes the session lock before close to prove ownership is rechecked, and hangs each successor arm to prove bounded fallback delivery includes the typed restoration failure.
The same suite covers ordinary same-process session replacement for `/new`, `/resume`, and `/fork`, same-instance shutdown-plus-start, stale prior-generation callbacks, repeated transitions with exactly one live cycle, disappearance of the shutting-down refusal after a valid replacement activates, and terminal quit still refusing late rearm.
It also covers a fresh factory bind without a prior shutdown: the superseded binding retires its arm child, cannot arm or reclaim ownership through retained session callbacks, the live binding keeps exactly one arm child, and repeated binds never accumulate more than one process-exit fallback.
`tests/fm-omp-primary.test.sh` covers OMP's binding of the same core to its native session, watcher, and shutdown surfaces, pins the input-preserving custom-steer delivery contract, pins the recovery handling handshake OMP performs before delivering that steer, and pins the single typed wake a refused handshake produces.
The opt-in `tests/fm-omp-primary-live-e2e.test.sh` proves a real OMP watcher wake reaches the session while its exact pending draft remains intact.
`tests/fm-watch-arm.test.sh` covers durable queue replay, real remote parent-replies ingestion into the authoritative status log, decision-only OPEN DECISIONS recovery, interrupted handling replay, generation-bound acknowledgement, a persistent live successor after recovery, a watcher close inside the handling window that must leave the printed acknowledgement valid, and the self-healing moved-generation acknowledgement that consumes its handled rows and names its remedy.
`tests/fm-watch-recovery-loop.test.sh` covers the once-per-generation announcement bound with the real Pi extension against a refused handling handshake, and a handling successor that must surface a real crew event instead of going blind.
Pi and OMP share `bin/fm-primary-watch-core.ts` here, so that Pi-driven coverage exercises the same confirmation, retry, and typed-failure code OMP runs.
`tests/fm-watcher-lock.test.sh` covers verified-successor attach, recovery publication before stale-lock removal, the typed self-eviction failure, bounded and successor-linked lifecycle rows, and a SIGSTOP counterfactual that distinguishes a live PID from a stale beacon before classifying termination.
`tests/fm-subagent-pretool-check.test.sh` proves Claude retains only the non-status Bash seatbelts.
`tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm.test.sh` covers the auto-arm's scope, stale and live session owners, unchanged AFK and need boundaries, single-flight, bounded failure retries, benign live-watcher cycle ends, one-notice failure episodes, and exit-2 translation.
`FM_CLAUDE_LIVE_E2E=1 tests/fm-claude-stop-autoarm-live-e2e.test.sh` starts with the reproduced stale-lock state, runs session start first, completes two tokenless cycles, and checks the competing-live-owner negative control.
`tests/fm-turnend-guard.test.sh` covers the cooperative `--claude` guard, including monotonic failed-epoch progression, the integrated bounded fail-open, post-alarm continuation suppression, and positive recovery reset.

## Active limits and verification

The goal is continuity without a Pi, OMP, or OpenCode model-memory re-arm step.
No zero-latency guarantee is claimed because lock verification, watcher startup, and bounded retry delays remain deliberate safety work.
OpenCode support targets persistent TUI sessions rather than headless `opencode run`.
Claude depends on the Stop `asyncRewake` rewake, Grok retains native background-completion notifications, and Codex retains bounded foreground checkpoints.

[`verification/supervision.md`](verification/supervision.md#watcher-continuity) records the current six-harness live evidence, the 2026-07-24 Stop-owned Claude auto-arm results, and exact opt-in commands.
